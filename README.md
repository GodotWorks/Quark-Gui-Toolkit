### What is it?

Quark toolkit is a powerful, extensible GUI Toolkit written in C++ and OpenGL / ES 3.0. It runs natively on Linux, macOS, Windows, and several BSD flavors.
It comes with a scene graph, a variety of useful widgets, a powerful built-in theming system, and support for extension through any language that can interface with C bindings.

Internally, Quark is based on the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org) core, but strips it down to only those features useful for GUI development in order to have the smallest library size possible.
